export function buildParentalLeavePlan(enrollmentPortalUrl: string, hrPhone: string): string {

Step 1 - Short-Term Disability (STD) via Unum
- STD covers disability from delivery itself (childbirth is a covered disability event).
- Standard benefit: 60% of weekly salary after the elimination period (typically 7 days for illness).
- Duration: up to 26 weeks from the qualifying disability date.
- File your STD claim with Unum before your due date. Unum will coordinate with your OB to confirm delivery date and disability period.

Step 2 - FMLA (Federal Family and Medical Leave Act)
- FMLA provides up to 12 weeks of job-protected, unpaid leave per year.
- Runs concurrently with STD, not consecutively - they overlap during the STD period.
- Eligibility: 12 months of employment and 1,250 hours worked in the past 12 months at a covered employer.
- File FMLA paperwork with HR at least 30 days before your expected leave date when possible.

Step 3 - Company / Employer Paid Leave (if applicable)
- Check your offer letter and HR handbook for any employer-paid parental leave benefit beyond STD.
- Employer-paid leave may stack before or after STD/FMLA - clarify with HR which runs first.
- PTO/vacation can typically be used to top up pay during any unpaid FMLA weeks.

Pay overlap edge cases:
- STD + FMLA overlap: You receive STD pay (60% salary) while FMLA job protection runs at the same time.
- If employer leave and STD overlap: most plans offset - you receive the higher of the two, not both added together. Confirm with Unum and HR.
- PTO coordination: some plans require you to exhaust PTO before STD begins. Check your STD certificate.
- Return-to-work: after FMLA expires, additional leave (bonding, non-medical) is at employer discretion and is unpaid unless a separate policy applies.

Recommended filing order: (1) Notify HR and file FMLA paperwork, (2) File STD claim with Unum, (3) Confirm any company leave policy with HR, (4) Coordinate PTO usage with payroll.
